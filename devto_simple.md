## 🐱 What is NekoCode?

NekoCode is a C++ code analyzer that's **10-100x faster** than Python alternatives. The best part? If you're using Claude Code (Anthropic's AI coding assistant), it works automatically!

## 🚀 Zero Setup for Claude Code Users

```bash
# Just clone it
git clone https://github.com/moe-charm/nekocode.git

# Tell Claude Code about it
You: "I cloned NekoCode locally. Use it to analyze my project."
Claude: "Found it! Building and analyzing..."
```

That's it. Claude Code will:
- Auto-detect NekoCode
- Build it automatically  
- Use it for lightning-fast code analysis
- Give you insights about complexity, dependencies, and more

## 📊 What's New in v2.0?

### 1. **Handles HUGE Projects** (30,000+ files)
```bash
# Non-blocking async analysis
./nekocode_ai session-create-async massive-project/
```

### 2. **std::regex Completely Eliminated**
- Before: 4 functions detected, frequent crashes
- After: 2,362 functions detected, zero crashes
- Result: **590x improvement!**

### 3. **Real-time Progress Tracking**
```bash
# See what's happening
tail -f sessions/*/progress.txt
```

### 4. **Runtime Debug Mode**
```bash
# No recompiling needed!
./nekocode_ai find "pattern" --debug
```

## 🎯 Tested on Real Projects

| Project | Files | Functions Found | Time |
|---------|-------|----------------|------|
| TypeScript Compiler | 20,700 | 2,362 | <5s |
| lodash.js | 544KB | 489 | <1s |
| Unity Game | 30,000+ | Thousands | Async |

## 💡 Why You Should Care

If you're:
- Using Claude Code for development
- Working with large codebases
- Tired of slow Python analyzers
- Want instant code insights

Then NekoCode is for you!
